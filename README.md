CaesarCipher
============

A C++ program that applies the ancient cipher technique used by the Romans. The cipher was invented by Caesar to encode his messages. All the letters in the message is shifted a user-specified "x" amount.

This program will either encode or decode a user-specified text file. You just need to tell it how many characters to shift by as the key.
